# Time App

My first ever almost completed app. It's the right partner when it comes to organize things.

## Getting Started

My first project and a Flutter app about productivity and time management, created with Flutter, Dart and Firebase.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
